# ResoniteMod-IgnoreControllerAxis
A [ResoniteModLoader](https://github.com/resonite-modding-group/ResoniteModLoader) mod for [Resonite](https://resonite.com/).

This mod enables the ability to make some joystick axis' not react at all or less to fight joystick drift.
This mod has some configs that need to be configured to be able to use this mod.
- Setting Deadzone on left or right controller
- Multiplying an axis on the input axis, which allows disabling a controller stick by multiplying it with 0
